The full description of the code and how to use the codes are detailed in the thesis.
Declaration -- For Matlab scripts, all the scripts had been writtten and debugged by the author. While Qupath script called 'ring-script' was written by Vitoria Pere. 
Other Qupath scripts were written by the author with Chat GPT used for dubugging the codes due to less familiarity with the programmin commands. However, all the ideas for algorithms were from the author.
